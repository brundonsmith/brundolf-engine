# brundolf-engine
Sometimes, when you mainly work in web development, you get an itch to do something more crunchy, mechanical, and close to the metal. Brundolf Engine is a C++ game engine that I work on when I need to scratch that itch. There are far better free options out there for creating an actual video game, but sometimes it's just nice to re-engineer something.
